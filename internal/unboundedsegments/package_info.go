// Package unboundedsegments is an internal package containing implementation types for the SDK's
// unbounded segment functionality, not including the part that is in go-server-sdk-evaluation. These
// types are not visible from outside of the SDK.
//
// This does not include implementations of specific unbounded segment store integrations such as Redis.
// Those are implemented in separate repositories such as
// https://github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk-redis-redigo.
